# VM-monitor-for-Multiple-Guests

## Overview  
This project implements an x86-based Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) capable of running multiple guest operating systems concurrently, including multiple instances of JOS. It enhances resource allocation, isolation, and security in multi-tenant environments, ensuring efficient utilization of hardware resources.

## Features  
- Supports multiple guest OS instances (e.g., JOS).  
- Efficient CPU, memory, and I/O resource management.  
- Strong isolation and security for multi-tenant environments.  
- Inter-guest communication and data-sharing mechanisms.  

## Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/vmm-project.git
   cd vmm-project
   ```
2. Build the VMM:  
   ```bash
   make
   ```
3. Run the VMM:  
   ```bash
   ./vmm
   ```  

## Usage  
- Load guest OS images and configure VM instances.  
- Monitor resource allocation and system performance.  
- Manage virtualized environments efficiently via CLI.  

## Future Enhancements  
- Improved scalability and support for more guest OS types.  
- Integration with modern security features for enhanced isolation.  
- Optimized resource allocation for cloud-based deployments.
