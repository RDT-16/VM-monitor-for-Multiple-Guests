# VM-monitor-for-Multiple-Guests

**Overview**

This project implements an x86-based Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) capable of running multiple guest operating systems concurrently, including multiple instances of JOS. It enhances resource allocation, isolation, and security in multi-tenant environments, ensuring efficient utilization of hardware resources.

**Features**

1) Supports multiple guest OS instances (e.g., JOS).
2) Efficient CPU, memory, and I/O resource management.
3) Strong isolation and security for multi-tenant environments.
4) Inter-guest communication and data-sharing mechanisms.

**Installation**

1) Clone the repository:
   '''bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/vmm-project.git
   cd vmm-project
